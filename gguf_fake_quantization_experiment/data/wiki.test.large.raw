The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a test sentence for evaluating language model performance. Natural language processing requires extensive datasets to properly evaluate model quality. Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability distribution predicts a sample. In the context of language models, it quantifies how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence. Lower perplexity indicates better predictive performance. Language models like GPT and BERT have revolutionized natural language understanding. They use transformer architectures to process sequential data effectively. Training these models requires significant computational resources and large datasets. The evaluation of language models involves various metrics including perplexity, BLEU scores, and human evaluation. Modern applications include text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering systems.
